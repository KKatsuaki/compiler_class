## Application

I added to this program comment fucntion and chage identifer's regex to "\[a-zA-Z\]\[A-Za-z0-9\]*" so that users can use the name they like.

## Syntax

The comment syntax which i added to this program is same as C or C++ language.

Thus, it could be below sample code.

```
program{
	asdf = 123 ;// this part is comment
	/*this part is also comment!*/
	write asdf;
}
```
